 <h1> Sonia's First Heading About Kombucha </h1>

 <h2>What is Kombucha?</h2>
    <p>Kombucha is a fizzy sweet-and-sour drink made with tea.
         Many people say it helps relieve or prevent a variety 
         of health problems, everything from hair loss to cancer 
         and AIDS. There’s little scientific evidence to back 
         up the claims, but some elements of the drink may be
          good for you.</p>
 <h2> Kombucha Health Benefits </h2>
<p>Advocates say it helps your digestion, rids your body 
    of toxins, and boosts your energy. It’s also said 
    to boost your immune system, help you lose weight,
     ward off high blood pressure and heart disease,
      and prevent cancer. But there’s not a lot of 
      evidence to support these claims. Claims about 
      kombucha’s power to aid digestion come from 
      the fact that fermentation makes probiotics. 
      Probiotics help with diarrhea and irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS), and they may even strengthen 
      your immune system.</p>

      <!-- Making The Risks In A Smaller Size -->
 <h5>Kombucha Risks</h5>
<p>Making kombucha involves letting bacteria grow in a liquid
     you’re going to drink. Many of the bacteria are considered 
     probiotics, but if it’s not prepared properly, it can grow 
     harmful bacteria or mold</p>

     <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
     <p>Kombucha is really good and I could drink it FOREVER</p>
