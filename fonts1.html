 <h1> Sonia's First Heading About Kombucha </h1>

 <h2>What is Kombucha?</h2>
    <p>Kombucha is a fizzy sweet-and-sour drink made with tea.
         Many people say it helps relieve or prevent a variety 
         of health problems, everything from hair loss to cancer 
         and AIDS. Thereâ€™s little scientific evidence to back 
         up the claims, but some elements of the drink may be
          good for you.</p>
